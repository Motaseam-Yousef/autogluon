# Multi-Task Learning with AutoGluon

This repository provides the code and resources for implementing multi-task learning using AutoGluon, a powerful machine learning library provided by AWS. Multi-task learning is an approach in which one model is trained on multiple tasks, potentially improving the model's performance and efficiency.

## Why Multi-Task Learning?

Multi-task learning offers several advantages:

- It allows the model to leverage information from multiple related tasks, potentially improving performance on all tasks.
- It can be more computationally efficient than training separate models for each task.
- It might help in reducing overfitting by providing more robustness.

## Why AutoGluon?

AutoGluon automates machine learning tasks enabling you to easily achieve strong predictive performance in your applications. With just a few lines of code, you can train and deploy high-accuracy deep learning models on tabular, text, and image data.

Key advantages of AutoGluon include:

- **Automatic model selection and hyperparameter tuning**: It automatically tries multiple models and hyperparameters to find the best model.
- **Easily accessible**: It requires minimal coding, making machine learning more accessible to non-experts and improving productivity of experts.
- **Flexible and extensible**: It provides options to use preset configurations for quick results and also allows you to create and customize models.
- **Built-in support for multi-task learning**: AutoGluon offers an in-built API for multi-task learning.
